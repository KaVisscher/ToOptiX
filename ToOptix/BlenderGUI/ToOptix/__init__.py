'''The following program uses any fem-program with an
inputdeck for topology optimisation

There are several classes which are needed for the initializing of
the nodes and elements. If you want to add a fem-program which does
not exist, just implement an ascci-file. And change the output ascci.
The whole optimisation process works with several dictonarys in
which are nodes and elements are saved.
