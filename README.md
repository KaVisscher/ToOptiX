## Topology optimization tool for multi physic 
This tool can be used for multi physic topology optimization.
Therefor open source solver for FEM like CalculiX can be used.
Models can be created with FreeCAD

## Current State 01.03.2017

- Using models for CalculiX (Can be created with FreeCAD for example)
- Structural topology optimization (static)
- Thermal topology optimization (heat transfer)
- Combination of thermal and structural (Weight factor)
- Plugin for Blender


## Future works (start at 01.08.2017)

- Code clean up
- Agile software development
- Code documentation
- Multi material (stabilized)
- Damage accumulation (Minor rule etc...)
- Restart option
- New physic types (Conduction, Electromagnetic, Electrostatic)
